Test number:     UR_2
Requirement:     Web Interface
Description:     User requires simple web interface to control the desired measurement streams.
Test:            To check whether the API program is accessible through curl/browser.

                 In Terminal type, “curl -u dpmi http://localhost:5000/<function>/<stream>”
                 Where, functions are: startstream.
                                       Stop.
                                       addstream.
                                       deletestream.
                                       changestream.
                                       showstream.
                                        
                 Note: while adding/deleting multiple streams separate streams using “,”
                       Ex: curl -u dpmi http://localhost:5000/addstream/01::01,01::02,01::03
                           curl -u dpmi http://localhost:5000/deletestream/01::01,01::02,01::03

Expected Result: ‘curl’ command should get executed without showing “Failed to connect port 5000: Connection Refused” error.
Test outcome:    API program is accessible without any error message.
