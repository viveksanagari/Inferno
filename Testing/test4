Test number:     UR_4
Requirement:     Response messages
Description:     The user should be displayed with appropriate response messages for the functions chosen.
Test:            To check whether the user is displayed with the appropriate return message.
                  
                 In Terminal or Browser type,
  
                 curl -u dpmi http://localhost:5000/startsream/<stream>
                 This should return: “...bitrate stream <stream> started...”
                 
                 curl -u dpmi http://localhost:5000/stop
                 This should return: “...bitrate stream killed...”

                 curl -u dpmi http://localhost:5000/addstream/<streams>
                 This should return: “...adding bitrate streams <streams>...”

                 curl -u dpmi http://localhost:5000/deletestream/<streams>
                 This should return: “...bitrate stream <streams> deleted...”
  
                 curl -u dpmi http://localhost:5000/changestream/<stream>
                 This should return: “...bitrate stream changed to <stream>...”

                 curl -u dpmi http://localhost:5000/showstream
                 This should return: “...running bitrate streams <streams> ...”
           
           Note: Trying to Start/add/change already running streams or trying to delete unavailable streams will display appropriate 
                 return messages.
           
Expected Result: User should be able to see the return message for the chosen function.
Test outcome:    Return messages for all the functionalities are being displayed properly.
